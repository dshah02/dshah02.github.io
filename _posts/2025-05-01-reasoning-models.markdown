# excerpt: We introduced a novel approach for improving large language model reasoning through contrastive goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Our method uses a combination of offline pretraining and online exploration to learn strategies for complex reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming supervised fine-tuning on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks.
