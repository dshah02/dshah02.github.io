# excerpt: We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFillâ€”a general-purpose fast generation method for any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. FutureFill reduces generation time from quadratic to quasilinear in the context length.
