excerpt: I work on accelerating inference with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gbrainprinceton/projects/spectral-transformers">Spectral Transformer</a>, a state space architecture for language modeling produced by Google DeepMind Princeton in collaboration with the Hazan Lab. I also worked on implementing Future Fill <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03766"> for fast autoregressive convolutions.
